matrix-synapse (0.33.2-2~jessie1) jessie; urgency=medium

  We will no longer be supplying updated Synapse packages for Debian 8 (Jessie):
  0.33.2 will be the last Synapse version packages for Jessie.

  The reason for this is that we are no longer able to support the old versions
  of python-twisted available for Jessie, and backporting a more recent version
  would be prohibitively time-consuming.

  There is more background at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3741.

  We recommend upgrading to Debian Stretch.
